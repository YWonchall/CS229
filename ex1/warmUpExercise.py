# ============= YOUR CODE HERE ==============
# Instructions: Return the 5x5 identity matrix
#               In octave, we return values by defining which variables
#               represent the return values (at the top of the file)
#               and then set them accordingly.
    
#    matrix = []
#    for i in range(5):
#        matrix.append([0,0,0,0,0])
#        matrix[i][i] = 1

    return eye(5)
